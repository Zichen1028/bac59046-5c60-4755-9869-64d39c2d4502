## Problem
Develop a function that takes one string input of any number of integers separated by single whitespace. The function then outputs the longest increasing subsequence (increased by any number) present in that sequence. If more than 1 sequence exists with the longest length, output the earliest one. You may develop supporting functions as many as you find reasonable.
